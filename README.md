Getting Started

Prerequisites


Any modern web browser
(Optional) A local static server for the smoothest development experience


Installation



Open index.html directly in your browser, or serve the folder locally:



# Or using the VS Code "Live Server" extension

Configuring the Contact Form

The contact form submits to Formspree. To enable it, open script.js and replace the placeholder form ID with your own Formspree endpoint:

jsconst FORMSPREE_FORM_ID = 'YOUR_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID'; // Replace with your actual Formspree form ID

Without a valid ID, form submissions will fail with a configuration error message.

Customization

To adapt this portfolio for your own use:


Update personal details, bio, and section copy directly in index.html.
Replace BUVAN.jpeg, BUVAN-PROFILE.jpeg, and icons-portfolio.png with your own images.
Edit the skills, experience, education, and project cards to reflect your own background.
Swap in your own resume PDF and update the corresponding download link.
Update social and profile links in the "Others" and "Contact" sections.


Deployment

 As a static site with no build step, it can also be deployed to any static hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify,Vercel etc.) by uploading the repository contents directly.
